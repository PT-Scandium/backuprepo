# Bug Log

Chronological log of bugs and their fixes. Each entry: date, issue, root cause, solution, prevention. Keep entries brief; remove very old (6+ month) entries when irrelevant.

## Format

```
### YYYY-MM-DD - Brief Description
- **Issue**: What went wrong
- **Root Cause**: Why it happened
- **Solution**: How it was fixed
- **Prevention**: How to avoid it
```

## Entries

_No bugs logged yet._

Candidates that were caught during the build review (not bugs, but worth knowing — see decisions.md):
- Root `errors.go` from the spec was infeasible (Go forbids `internal/` importing package `main`) → typed errors moved to `internal/apperr` (ADR-005).
- SQLCipher requires CGO, conflicting with the static-binary goal → switched to pure-Go SQLite + AES-GCM field encryption (ADR-001).
